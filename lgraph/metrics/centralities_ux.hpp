/* BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY */

/**
 * @brief Betweenness centrality of a node.
 *
 * This centrality measure is implemented following the recommendations
 * given in [Newman, 2010]:
 *	- Any path from vertex 's' to vertex 't' is considered to include both
 *		endpoints.
 *	- The equation to calculate the centrality also considers paths from any
 *		vertex to itself.
 *
 * Furthermore, only the pairs of vertices (s,t) with \f$s \le t\f$ are considered.
 * Finally, this metric is also normalised.
 *
 * The expression for this centrality \f$B_i^*\f$ is as follows:
 *
 * \f$ B_i = \sum_{j < k} \frac{g_{jk}(i)}{g_{jk}} \f$,
 * \f$B_i^* = B_i \cdot {n - 1 \choose 2}^{-1}\f$
 *
 * where \f$n\f$ is the number of nodes, \f$g_{jk}(i)\f$ is the number of
 * shortest paths from \f$j\f$ to \f$k\f$ through \f$i\f$, and \f$g_{jk}\f$ is
 * the number of shortest paths from \f$j\f$ to \f$k\f$.
 *
