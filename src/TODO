Implement generic DFS

[] 16/02/2018 ->
Implement the boolean path using actual bitsets (not vector<bool>)

[] 16/02/2018 ->
Implement betweennes centrality metric (that uses a path as a bitset)

	[] 16/02/2018 ->
	For a single vertex

	[] 16/02/2018 ->
	For all vertices of a graph

[] 13/02/2018 ->
Implement betweennes centrality metric

	[] 13/02/2018 ->
	For a single vertex

	[] 13/02/2018 ->
	For all vertices of a graph

[] 16/02/2018 ->
Implement algorithm to count the number of shortest pahts:

	[] 16/02/2018 ->
	Between two nodes

	[v] 16/02/2018 -> 17/02/2018
	From a node to the rest

	[v] 16/02/2018 -> 17/02/2018
	From a any node to any other node

[v] 13/02/2018 -> 16/02/2018
Implement two classes that implement paths as

	[v] 16/02/2018 -> 16/02/2018
	List of vertices

	[v] 16/02/2018 -> 16/02/2018
	Bitsets (a vertex is in the path if the corresponding bit is set to 1)

[v] 13/02/2018 -> 16/02/2018
Debug path-finding with BFS

[v] 13/02/2018 -> 16/02/2018
