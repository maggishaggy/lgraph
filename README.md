# Social Networks Algorithms

This repository includes a few Social and Complex Network algorithms:
+ To generate random graphs:
	- Barabasi-Albert model: this includes the variants:
		- Preferential attachment
		- Random attachment
		- No vertex growth

+ To modify networks:
	- Switching model

+ To quantify networks:
	- Clustering metrics:
		- Newman's global clustering coefficient
		- Watts & Strogatz's mean local clustering coefficient

The project may be compiled using the qmake tool.
